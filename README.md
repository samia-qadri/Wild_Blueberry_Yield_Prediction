PROJECT: Wild_Blueberry_Yield_Prediction.

Hello ! Assalam-u-Alaikum.
My name is **Samia Qadri**, student of software Engineering, UBIT, University of Karachi.
This is my AI and Data Science Project.

The goal of this project is to help farmers and agricultural planners predict blueberry yield efficiently using machine learning techniques. Multiple models are implemented and evaluated to find the best-performing one.

**Models used:**
 > linear Regression.
 > Decision Tree regressor.
 >  Random Forest Regressor.
 >  XGBOOST Regressor.
